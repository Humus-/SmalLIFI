# SmalLIFI

just a basic prototype to understand and implement Light Fidelity (LIFI)


###TODO

- Implementing a modulation scheme for light tranfer(frequency modulation)
- Preventing overvoltage, reverse-polarity 
- Multiple Data transfer(8 bytes to 16 bytes check)*
- Checking for P-I-N Diode most and least sensitive colour practically
- Need to complete this by this week by 14.08.16
